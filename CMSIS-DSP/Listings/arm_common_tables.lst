N/**
N   \mainpage CMSIS DSP Software Library
N   *
N   * Introduction
N   * ------------
N   *
N   * This user manual describes the CMSIS DSP software library,
N   * a suite of common signal processing functions for use on Cortex-M processor based devices.
N   *
N   * The library is divided into a number of functions each covering a specific category:
N   * - Basic math functions
N   * - Fast math functions
N   * - Complex math functions
N   * - Filters
N   * - Matrix functions
N   * - Transforms
N   * - Motor control functions
N   * - Statistical functions
N   * - Support functions
N   * - Interpolation functions
N   *
N   * The library has separate functions for operating on 8-bit integers, 16-bit integers,
N   * 32-bit integer and 32-bit floating-point values.
N   *
N   * Using the Library
N   * ------------
N   *
N   * The library installer contains prebuilt versions of the libraries in the <code>Lib</code> folder.
N   * - arm_cortexM4lf_math.lib (Little endian and Floating Point Unit on Cortex-M4)
N   * - arm_cortexM4bf_math.lib (Big endian and Floating Point Unit on Cortex-M4)
N   * - arm_cortexM4l_math.lib (Little endian on Cortex-M4)
N   * - arm_cortexM4b_math.lib (Big endian on Cortex-M4)
N   * - arm_cortexM3l_math.lib (Little endian on Cortex-M3)
N   * - arm_cortexM3b_math.lib (Big endian on Cortex-M3)
N   * - arm_cortexM0l_math.lib (Little endian on Cortex-M0)
N   * - arm_cortexM0b_math.lib (Big endian on Cortex-M3)
N   *
N   * The library functions are declared in the public file <code>arm_math.h</code> which is placed in the <code>Include</code> folder.
N   * Simply include this file and link the appropriate library in the application and begin calling the library functions. The Library supports single
N   * public header file <code> arm_math.h</code> for Cortex-M4/M3/M0 with little endian and big endian. Same header file will be used for floating point unit(FPU) variants.
N   * Define the appropriate pre processor MACRO ARM_MATH_CM4 or  ARM_MATH_CM3 or
N   * ARM_MATH_CM0 or ARM_MATH_CM0PLUS depending on the target processor in the application.
N   *
N   * Examples
N   * --------
N   *
N   * The library ships with a number of examples which demonstrate how to use the library functions.
N   *
N   * Toolchain Support
N   * ------------
N   *
N   * The library has been developed and tested with MDK-ARM version 4.60.
N   * The library is being tested in GCC and IAR toolchains and updates on this activity will be made available shortly.
N   *
N   * Building the Library
N   * ------------
N   *
N   * The library installer contains a project file to re build libraries on MDK-ARM Tool chain in the <code>CMSIS\\DSP_Lib\\Source\\ARM</code> folder.
N   * - arm_cortexM_math.uvproj
N   *
N   *
N   * The libraries can be built by opening the arm_cortexM_math.uvproj project in MDK-ARM, selecting a specific target, and defining the optional pre processor MACROs detailed above.
N   *
N   * Pre-processor Macros
N   * ------------
N   *
N   * Each library project have differant pre-processor macros.
N   *
N   * - UNALIGNED_SUPPORT_DISABLE:
N   *
N   * Define macro UNALIGNED_SUPPORT_DISABLE, If the silicon does not support unaligned memory access
N   *
N   * - ARM_MATH_BIG_ENDIAN:
N   *
N   * Define macro ARM_MATH_BIG_ENDIAN to build the library for big endian targets. By default library builds for little endian targets.
N   *
N   * - ARM_MATH_MATRIX_CHECK:
N   *
N   * Define macro ARM_MATH_MATRIX_CHECK for checking on the input and output sizes of matrices
N   *
N   * - ARM_MATH_ROUNDING:
N   *
N   * Define macro ARM_MATH_ROUNDING for rounding on support functions
N   *
N   * - ARM_MATH_CMx:
N   *
N   * Define macro ARM_MATH_CM4 for building the library on Cortex-M4 target, ARM_MATH_CM3 for building library on Cortex-M3 target
N   * and ARM_MATH_CM0 for building library on cortex-M0 target, ARM_MATH_CM0PLUS for building library on cortex-M0+ target.
N   *
N   * - __FPU_PRESENT:
N   *
N   * Initialize macro __FPU_PRESENT = 1 when building on FPU supported Targets. Enable this macro for M4bf and M4lf libraries
N   *

N
N/**
N * @defgroup groupFastMath Fast Math Functions
N * This set of functions provides a fast approximation to sine, cosine, and square root.
N * As compared to most of the other functions in the CMSIS math library, the fast math functions
N * operate on individual values and not arrays.
N * There are separate functions for Q15, Q31, and floating-point data.
N *
N */
N
N/**
N * @defgroup groupCmplxMath Complex Math Functions
N * This set of functions operates on complex data vectors.
N * The data in the complex arrays is stored in an interleaved fashion
N * (real, imag, real, imag, ...).
N * In the API functions, the number of samples in a complex array refers
N * to the number of complex values; the array contains twice this number of
N * real values.
N */
N
N/**
N * @defgroup groupFilters Filtering Functions
N */
N
N/**
N * @defgroup groupMatrix Matrix Functions
N *
N * This set of functions provides basic matrix math operations.
N * The functions operate on matrix data structures.  For example,
N * the type
N * definition for the floating-point matrix structure is shown
N * below:
N * <pre>
N *     typedef struct
N *     {
N *       uint16_t numRows;     // number of rows of the matrix.
N *       uint16_t numCols;     // number of columns of the matrix.
N *       float32_t *pData;     // points to the data of the matrix.
N *     } arm_matrix_instance_f32;
N * </pre>
N * There are similar definitions for Q15 and Q31 data types.
N *
N * The structure specifies the size of the matrix and then points to
N * an array of data.  The array is of size <code>numRows X numCols</code>
N * and the values are arranged in row order.  That is, the
N * matrix element (i, j) is stored at:
N * <pre>
N *     pData[i*numCols + j]
N * </pre>
N *
N * \par Init Functions
N * There is an associated initialization function for each type of matrix
N * data structure.
N * The initialization function sets the values of the internal structure fields.
N * Refer to the function <code>arm_mat_init_f32()</code>, <code>arm_mat_init_q31()</code>
N * and <code>arm_mat_init_q15()</code> for floating-point, Q31 and Q15 types,  respectively.
N *
N * \par
N * Use of the initialization function is optional. However, if initialization function is used
N * then the instance structure cannot be placed into a const data section.
N * To place the instance structure in a const data
N * section, manually initialize the data structure.  For example:
N * <pre>
N * <code>arm_matrix_instance_f32 S = {nRows, nColumns, pData};</code>
N * <code>arm_matrix_instance_q31 S = {nRows, nColumns, pData};</code>
N * <code>arm_matrix_instance_q15 S = {nRows, nColumns, pData};</code>
N * </pre>
N * where <code>nRows</code> specifies the number of rows, <code>nColumns</code>
N * specifies the number of columns, and <code>pData</code> points to the
N * data array.
N *
N * \par Size Checking
N * By default all of the matrix functions perform size checking on the input and
N * output matrices.  For example, the matrix addition function verifies that the
N * two input matrices and the output matrix all have the same number of rows and
N * columns.  If the size check fails the functions return:
N * <pre>
N *     ARM_MATH_SIZE_MISMATCH
N * </pre>
N * Otherwise the functions return
N * <pre>
N *     ARM_MATH_SUCCESS
N * </pre>
N * There is some overhead associated with this matrix size checking.
N * The matrix size checking is enabled via the \#define
N * <pre>
N *     ARM_MATH_MATRIX_CHECK
N * </pre>
N * within the library project settings.  By default this macro is defined
N * and size checking is enabled.  By changing the project settings and
N * undefining this macro size checking is eliminated and the functions
N * run a bit faster.  With size checking disabled the functions always
N * return <code>ARM_MATH_SUCCESS</code>.

N     * Just like memcpy and memmove, the "cpy" functions copy as
N     * fast as they can in the assumption that the memory regions
N     * do not overlap, while the "move" functions cope correctly
N     * with overlap.
N     *
N     * Treating memory as a stream of individual bits requires
N     * defining a convention about what order those bits are
N     * considered to be arranged in. The above functions support
N     * multiple conventions:
N     * 
N     *  - the "bl" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    byte, and consider the bits within each byte to be
N     *    arranged in little-endian fashion, so that the LSB comes
N     *    first. (For example, membitcpybl(a,b,0,7,1) would copy
N     *    the MSB of the byte at b to the LSB of the byte at a.)
N     * 
N     *  - the "bb" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    byte, and consider the bits within each byte to be
N     *    arranged in big-endian fashion, so that the MSB comes
N     *    first.
N     * 
N     *  - the "hl" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    16-bit halfword, and consider the bits within each word
N     *    to be arranged in little-endian fashion.
N     * 
N     *  - the "hb" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    16-bit halfword, and consider the bits within each word
N     *    to be arranged in big-endian fashion.
N     * 
N     *  - the "wl" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    32-bit word, and consider the bits within each word to be
N     *    arranged in little-endian fashion.
N     * 
N     *  - the "wb" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    32-bit word, and consider the bits within each word to be
N     *    arranged in big-endian fashion.

N   *
N   * A Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller is a generic feedback control
N   * loop mechanism widely used in industrial control systems.
N   * A PID controller is the most commonly used type of feedback controller.
N   *
N   * This set of functions implements (PID) controllers
N   * for Q15, Q31, and floating-point data types.  The functions operate on a single sample
N   * of data and each call to the function returns a single processed value.
N   * <code>S</code> points to an instance of the PID control data structure.  <code>in</code>
N   * is the input sample value. The functions return the output value.
N   *
N   * \par Algorithm:
N   * <pre>
N   *    y[n] = y[n-1] + A0 * x[n] + A1 * x[n-1] + A2 * x[n-2]
N   *    A0 = Kp + Ki + Kd
N   *    A1 = (-Kp ) - (2 * Kd )
N   *    A2 = Kd  </pre>
N   *
N   * \par
N   * where \c Kp is proportional constant, \c Ki is Integral constant and \c Kd is Derivative constant
N   *
N   * \par
N   * \image html PID.gif "Proportional Integral Derivative Controller"
N   *
N   * \par
N   * The PID controller calculates an "error" value as the difference between
N   * the measured output and the reference input.
N   * The controller attempts to minimize the error by adjusting the process control inputs.
N   * The proportional value determines the reaction to the current error,
N   * the integral value determines the reaction based on the sum of recent errors,
N   * and the derivative value determines the reaction based on the rate at which the error has been changing.
N   *
N   * \par Instance Structure
N   * The Gains A0, A1, A2 and state variables for a PID controller are stored together in an instance data structure.
N   * A separate instance structure must be defined for each PID Controller.
N   * There are separate instance structure declarations for each of the 3 supported data types.
N   *
N   * \par Reset Functions
N   * There is also an associated reset function for each data type which clears the state array.
N   *
N   * \par Initialization Functions
N   * There is also an associated initialization function for each data type.
N   * The initialization function performs the following operations:
N   * - Initializes the Gains A0, A1, A2 from Kp,Ki, Kd gains.
N   * - Zeros out the values in the state buffer.
N   *
N   * \par
N   * Instance structure cannot be placed into a const data section and it is recommended to use the initialization function.
N   *
N   * \par Fixed-Point Behavior
N   * Care must be taken when using the fixed-point versions of the PID Controller functions.
N   * In particular, the overflow and saturation behavior of the accumulator used in each function must be considered.
N   * Refer to the function specific documentation below for usage guidelines.

N   * Linear interpolation is a method of curve fitting using linear polynomials.
N   * Linear interpolation works by effectively drawing a straight line between two neighboring samples and returning the appropriate point along that line

N   * A  Linear Interpolate function calculates an output value(y), for the input(x)
N   * using linear interpolation of the input values x0, x1( nearest input values) and the output values y0 and y1(nearest output values)
N   *
N   * \par Algorithm:
N   * <pre>
N   *       y = y0 + (x - x0) * ((y1 - y0)/(x1-x0))
N   *       where x0, x1 are nearest values of input x
N   *             y0, y1 are nearest values to output y
N   * </pre>
N   *
N   * \par
N   * This set of functions implements Linear interpolation process
N   * for Q7, Q15, Q31, and floating-point data types.  The functions operate on a single
N   * sample of data and each call to the function returns a single processed value.
N   * <code>S</code> points to an instance of the Linear Interpolate function data structure.
N   * <code>x</code> is the input sample value. The functions returns the output value.
N   *
N   * \par
N   * if x is outside of the table boundary, Linear interpolation returns first value of the table
N   * if x is below input range and returns last value of table if x is above range.

N   * @defgroup BilinearInterpolate Bilinear Interpolation
N   *
N   * Bilinear interpolation is an extension of linear interpolation applied to a two dimensional grid.
N   * The underlying function <code>f(x, y)</code> is sampled on a regular grid and the interpolation process
N   * determines values between the grid points.
N   * Bilinear interpolation is equivalent to two step linear interpolation, first in the x-dimension and then in the y-dimension.
N   * Bilinear interpolation is often used in image processing to rescale images.
N   * The CMSIS DSP library provides bilinear interpolation functions for Q7, Q15, Q31, and floating-point data types.
N   *
N   * <b>Algorithm</b>
N   * \par
N   * The instance structure used by the bilinear interpolation functions describes a two dimensional data table.
N   * For floating-point, the instance structure is defined as:
N   * <pre>
N   *   typedef struct
N   *   {
N   *     uint16_t numRows;
N   *     uint16_t numCols;
N   *     float32_t *pData;
N   * } arm_bilinear_interp_instance_f32;
N   * </pre>
N   *
N   * \par
N   * where <code>numRows</code> specifies the number of rows in the table;
N   * <code>numCols</code> specifies the number of columns in the table;
N   * and <code>pData</code> points to an array of size <code>numRows*numCols</code> values.
N   * The data table <code>pTable</code> is organized in row order and the supplied data values fall on integer indexes.
N   * That is, table element (x,y) is located at <code>pTable[x + y*numCols]</code> where x and y are integers.
N   *
N   * \par
N   * Let <code>(x, y)</code> specify the desired interpolation point.  Then define:
N   * <pre>
N   *     XF = floor(x)
N   *     YF = floor(y)
N   * </pre>
N   * \par
N   * The interpolated output point is computed as:
N   * <pre>
N   *  f(x, y) = f(XF, YF) * (1-(x-XF)) * (1-(y-YF))
N   *           + f(XF+1, YF) * (x-XF)*(1-(y-YF))
N   *           + f(XF, YF+1) * (1-(x-XF))*(y-YF)
N   *           + f(XF+1, YF+1) * (x-XF)*(y-YF)
N   * </pre>
N   * Note that the coordinates (x, y) contain integer and fractional components.
N   * The integer components specify which portion of the table to use while the
N   * fractional components control the interpolation processor.
N   *
N   * \par
N   * if (x,y) are outside of the table boundary, Bilinear interpolation returns zero output.
